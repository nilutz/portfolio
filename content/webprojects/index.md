### Web Projects

I am not a designer, still sometimes I develop webpages. Currently I mainly use React and its static site generator [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here a short list of current web projects are presented with its unique points are presented:

* [This portfolio](https://nilutz.github.io/portfolio/). Deployed via githubPages uses React-MD and Markdown. Have a look at the [source code](https://github.com/nilutz/portfolio) for more information
* [Leonie-Janssen-Rechtsanw√§ltin.de](). A very simple site for a lawyer.
* [AHa-plan.de](http://www.aha-plan.de/). Using netlify, the site updates itself when a new blogpost is added to the repository. Also utilizes [i18n](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next) for several languages. Have a look at the [source code](https://github.com/nilutz/aha-plan) for more information
