    <h2> Hi, </h2>
    <p>
      this portfolio presents current and past projects. In 2015 I did my
      Bachelor in Cognitive Science, right know i am studying the Master of
      Computer Science in Bonn. Machine Learning, Deep Learning and current Web
      technolgies gather my curiosity. But I enjoy going to the playground with
      my daughter, sports and reading. {" "}
